        Se considera Homo sapiens de forma indiscutible tanto a los que poseen
        las características anatómicas de las poblaciones humanas actuales como
        lo que se define como «comportamiento moderno». Los restos más antiguos
        atribuidos a Homo sapiens se encuentran en Marruecos, con 315 000
        años.2​ Las evidencias más antiguas de comportamiento moderno son las de
        Pinnacle Point (Sudáfrica), con 165 000 años. Pertenece al género Homo,
        que fue más diversificado y durante el último millón y medio de años
        incluía otras especies ya extintas. Desde la extinción del Homo
        neanderthalensis, hace 28 000 años, y del Homo floresiensis hace 12 000
        años (debatible), el Homo sapiens es la única especie conocida del
        género Homo que aún perdura. Hasta hace poco, la biología utilizaba un
        nombre trinomial —Homo sapiens sapiens— para esta especie, pero más
        recientemente se ha descartado el nexo filogenético entre el neandertal
        y la actual humanidad,3​ por lo que se usa exclusivamente el nombre
        binomial. Homo sapiens pertenece a una estirpe de primates, los
        hominoideos. Aunque el descubrimiento de Homo sapiens idaltu en 2003
        haría necesario volver al sistema trinomial, la posición taxonómica de
        este último es aún incierta.4​ Evolutivamente se diferenció en África y
        de ese ancestro surgió la familia de la que forman parte los homínidos.
        Filosóficamente, el ser humano se ha definido y redefinido a sí mismo de
        numerosas maneras a través de la historia, otorgándose de esta manera un
        propósito positivo o negativo respecto de su propia existencia. Existen
        diversos sistemas religiosos e ideales filosóficos que, de acuerdo con
        una diversa gama de culturas e ideales individuales, tienen como
        propósito y función responder a algunas de esas interrogantes
        existenciales. Los seres humanos tienen la capacidad de ser conscientes
        de sí mismos, así como de su pasado; saben que tienen el poder de
        planear, transformar y realizar proyectos de diversos tipos. En función
        de esta capacidad, han creado diversos códigos morales y dogmas
        orientados directamente al manejo de estas capacidades. Además, pueden
        ser conscientes de responsabilidades y peligros provenientes de la
        naturaleza, así como de otros seres humanos.

          he equivalent of the Eurasian Upper Paleolithic in African archaeology is known as the Later Stone Age, also beginning roughly 40,000 years ago. While most clear evidence for behavioral modernity uncovered from the later 19th century was from Europe, such as the Venus figurines and other artefacts from the Aurignacian, more recent archaeological research has shown that all essential elements of the kind of material culture typical of contemporary San hunter-gatherers in Southern Africa was also present by at least 40,000 years ago, including digging sticks of similar materials used today, ostrich egg shell beads, bone arrow heads with individual maker's marks etched and embedded with red ochre, and poison applicators.[141] There is also a suggestion that "pressure flaking best explains the morphology of lithic artifacts recovered from the c. 75-ka Middle Stone Age levels at Blombos Cave, South Africa. The technique was used during the final shaping of Still Bay bifacial points made on heat‐treated silcrete."[142] Both pressure flaking and heat treatment of materials were previously thought to have occurred much later in prehistory, and both indicate a behaviourally modern sophistication in the use of natural materials. Further reports of research on cave sites along the southern African coast indicate that "the debate as to when cultural and cognitive characteristics typical of modern humans first appeared" may be coming to an end, as "advanced technologies with elaborate chains of production" which "often demand high-fidelity transmission and thus language" have been found at the South African Pinnacle Point Site 5–6. These have been dated to approximately 71,000 years ago. The researchers suggest that their research "shows that microlithic technology originated early in South Africa by 71 kya, evolved over a vast time span (c. 11,000 years), and was typically coupled to complex heat treatment that persisted for nearly 100,000 years. Advanced technologies in Africa were early and enduring; a small sample of excavated sites in Africa is the best explanation for any perceived 'flickering' pattern."[143] These results suggest that Late Stone Age foragers in Sub-Saharan Africa had developed modern cognition and behaviour by at least 50,000 years ago.[144] The change in behavior has been speculated to have been a consequence of an earlier climatic change to much drier and colder conditions between 135,000 and 75,000 years ago.[145] This might have led to human groups who were seeking refuge from the inland droughts, expanded along the coastal marshes rich in shellfish and other resources. Since sea levels were low due to so much water tied up in glaciers, such marshlands would have occurred all along the southern coasts of Eurasia. The use of rafts and boats may well have facilitated exploration of offshore islands and travel along the coast, and eventually permitted expansion to New Guinea and then to Australia.[146]

In addition, a variety of other evidence of abstract imagery, widened subsistence strategies, and other "modern" behaviors has been discovered in Africa, especially South, North, and East Africa, predating 50,000 years ago. The Blombos Cave site in South Africa, for example, is famous for rectangular slabs of ochre engraved with geometric designs. Using multiple dating techniques, the site was confirmed to be around 77,000 and 100–75,000 years old.[147][148] Ostrich egg shell containers engraved with geometric designs dating to 60,000 years ago were found at Diepkloof, South Africa.[149] Beads and other personal ornamentation have been found from Morocco which might be as much as 130,000 years old; as well, the Cave of Hearths in South Africa has yielded a number of beads dating from significantly prior to 50,000 years ago,[150] and shell beads dating to about 75,000 years ago have been found at Blombos Cave, South Africa.[151][152][153] Specialized projectile weapons as well have been found at various sites in Middle Stone Age Africa, including bone and stone arrowheads at South African sites such as Sibudu Cave (along with an early bone needle also found at Sibudu) dating approximately 60,000-70,000 years ago,[154][155][156][157][158] and bone harpoons at the Central African site of Katanda dating ca. 90,000 years ago.[159] Evidence also exists for the systematic heat treating of silcrete stone to increased its flake-ability for the purpose of toolmaking, beginning approximately 164,000 years ago at the South African site of Pinnacle Point and becoming common there for the creation of microlithic tools at about 72,000 years ago.[160][143]

In 2008, an ochre processing workshop likely for the production of paints was uncovered dating to ca. 100,000 years ago at Blombos Cave, South Africa. Analysis shows that a liquefied pigment-rich mixture was produced and stored in the two abalone shells, and that ochre, bone, charcoal, grindstones and hammer-stones also formed a composite part of the toolkits. Evidence for the complexity of the task includes procuring and combining raw materials from various sources (implying they had a mental template of the process they would follow), possibly using pyrotechnology to facilitate fat extraction from bone, using a probable recipe to produce the compound, and the use of shell containers for mixing and storage for later use.[161][162][163] Modern behaviors, such as the making of shell beads, bone tools and arrows, and the use of ochre pigment, are evident at a Kenyan site by 78,000-67,000 years ago.[164] Evidence of early stone-tipped projectile weapons (a characteristic tool of Homo sapiens), the stone tips of javelins or throwing spears, were discovered in 2013 at the Ethiopian site of Gademotta, and date to around 279,000 years ago.[165]

      <p class="p3">Annona muricata is a small, upright, evergreen tree that can grow to about 30 feet (9.1 m) tall.[4][5][8][9]

        Its young branches are hairy.[9] Leaves are oblong to oval, 8 centimetres (3.1 in) to 16 centimetres (6.3 in) long and 3 centimetres (1.2 in) to 7 centimetres (2.8 in) wide. They are a glossy dark green with no hairs above, and paler and minutely hairy to no hairs below.[9] The leaf stalks are 4 millimetres (0.16 in) to 13 millimetres (0.51 in) long and without hairs.[9]
        
        Flower stalks (peduncles) are 2 millimetres (0.079 in) to 5 millimetres (0.20 in) long and woody. They appear opposite from the leaves or as an extra from near the leaf stalk, each with one or two flowers, occasionally a third.[9] Stalks for the individual flowers (pedicels) are stout and woody, minutely hairy to hairless and 15 millimetres (0.59 in) to 20 millimetres (0.79 in) with small bractlets nearer to the base which are densely hairy.[9]
        
        The petals are thick and yellowish. Outer petals meet at the edges without overlapping and are broadly ovate, 2.8 centimetres (1.1 in) to 3.3 centimetres (1.3 in) by 2.1 centimetres (0.83 in) to 2.5 centimetres (0.98 in), tapering to a point with a heart shaped base. They are evenly thick, and are covered with long, slender, soft hairs externally and matted finely with soft hairs within. Inner petals are oval shaped and overlap. They measure roughly 2.5 centimetres (0.98 in) to 2.8 centimetres (1.1 in) by 2 centimetres (0.79 in), and are sharply angled and tapering at the base. Margins are comparatively thin, with fine matted soft hairs on both sides. The receptacle is conical and hairy. The stamens are 4.5 millimetres (0.18 in) long and narrowly wedge-shaped. The connective-tip terminate abruptly and anther hollows are unequal. Sepals are quite thick and do not overlap. Carpels are linear and basally growing from one base. The ovaries are covered with dense reddish brown hairs, 1-ovuled, style short and stigma truncate.[9] Its pollen is shed as permanent tetrads.[10]
        
        The fruits are dark green and prickly. They are ovoid and can be up to 30 centimetres (12 in) long,[9] with a moderately firm texture.[6] Their flesh is juicy, acid, whitish[6] and aromatic.[9]</p>
